Need to handle word-wrapping, window resizing.

Viewportal calculation should mark offscreen dirty when there is a change.
UPDATE: remove offscreen dirty flag, and only call offscreen draw explicitly at end.

ALSO: remove pixlines dirty flag, only attempt to draw pixlines when called explicitly, when text received or window resized, limit to X items before releasing lock and sleeping.
SPEEDUP: render to temporary local, lock and copy at end to reduce locked time?

Need to handle scrollback rotating buffer, maybe just give every line a seqential number?
Delete current line cache number - max scrollback cache number
Rendering should always be done newest to oldest history.


Add settings JSON, start work on bookmark/settings/input UI.
Add support for system fonts.
